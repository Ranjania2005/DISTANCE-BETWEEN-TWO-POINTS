# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
  
```
import math 
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print(f"{d:.2f}")
```

### OUTPUT:
